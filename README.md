# Fast-BitArray-JS

A **very** fast BitArray implementation in JavaScript!

Example test output:

<pre id="outputPre" style="font-size: 10px;">
Current bit array type: Int8Array

                Assignment of 100000000 bits took:  509ms
Creation and deletion of 1000 X 1000000 bits took:  114ms

      Size in bits: 100000000
  Raw size in bits: 100000000
 Raw size in bytes:  12500000
Raw size in arrays:  12500000

                          Individual tests:
           (bit % 2) & 1: 01010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101
                 cleared: 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
           (bit % 3) & 1: 01001001001001001001001001001001001001001001001001
                 toggled: 10110110110110110110110110110110110110110110110110
            ANDed with 0: 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
 ORed with (bit % 7) & 1: 01010100101010010101001010100101010010101001010100
XORed with (bit % 2) & 1: 00000001111111000000011111110000000111111100000001

Resize smaller then larger test (should see 0101): 0101

          Aggregate tests:
Original: 0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0
-----------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------
 Toggled: 1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1
   Other: 0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0
-----------------------------------------------------------
   ANDed: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
-----------------------------------------------------------
    ORed: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
-----------------------------------------------------------
   XORed: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1


Time it took to do all of the above:   749ms

All of the above was generated by `test.js`; see that file for examples of how to use the `BitArray` class in `BitArray.js`.

## About

This implementation:
- is ***extremely fast*** (as you can see in the example test output)!
- provides a seamless abstraction over as many or as few bits as is wanted
  - uses `0` and `1` values (no `false` nor `true` etc.)
  - does ***not*** require the number of bits to be in multiples of anything (e.g. 8 or 32)
- provides individual bit reading and modification functionality
- provides aggregate + dual-`BitArray`-combination functionality
- provides cloning and resizing (both up and down, in number of bits) functionality
- provides `toString()` and `toDelimitedString(delimiter)` functions, as well as `startAt` and `upTo` options to these functions to only convert a subset of the `BitArray` to a string
  - the `delimiter` string will be inserted in between (but not around) every bit converted to a string
- utilizes 1 of several [Int and Uint Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects) options under-the-hood ([see also](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators))
  - You can select whichever bit array type you would like it to use upon creation: see `BitArrayTypes`, `DefaultBitArrayType`, and `BitArray.create()`, all in `BitArray.js`
    - In testing, `Int8Array` was the overall fastest of the group, it was only slower than the others for creation of very large numbers of bits; therefore, `Int8Array` is the default
    - No 64-bit options allowed, because JS can't handle bit operations > 32 bits!
    - `Array` and `Float32Array` were also removed, because they function differently than the Ints and Uints
  - Note: The combine BitArrays functions are not built to support differing bit array types
