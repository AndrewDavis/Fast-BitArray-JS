# Fast-BitArray-JS

A very fast BitArray (or ByteArray) implementation in JavaScript!

Example test output:

<pre id="outputPre">
                     Assignment of 100000000 bits took: 318ms
Creation and deletion of 1000000 X 100000000 bits took: 41ms

 Size in bits: 100000000
Size in bytes:  12500000
Size in uints:   3125000

                          Individual tests:
           (bit % 2) & 1: 01010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101
                 cleared: 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
           (bit % 3) & 1: 01001001001001001001001001001001001001001001001001
                 toggled: 10110110110110110110110110110110110110110110110110
            ANDed with 0: 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
 ORed with (bit % 7) & 1: 01010100101010010101001010100101010010101001010100
XORed with (bit % 2) & 1: 00000001111111000000011111110000000111111100000001

Resize smaller then larger test (should see 0101): 0101

          Aggregate tests:

## About

This implementation:
- is ***extremely fast*** (as you can see in the example test output)!
- provides a seamless abstraction over as many or as few bits as is wanted
  - uses `0` and `1` values (no `false` nor `true` etc.)
  - does ***not*** require the number of bits to be in multiples of anything (e.g. 8 or 32)
- provides individual bit reading and modification functionality
- provides aggregate + dual-`BitArray`-combination functionality
- provides cloning and resizing (both up and down) functionality
- utilizes [Uint32Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint32Array) under-the-hood ([see also](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators))
